	<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
	<div class="w3-cell-row">
	<div style="width:5%" class="w3-cell"></div>
	<div style="align:center">
	<p style="text-align:center">In metro Phoenix, there are no public grass or clay courts. There are several private clubs with them, and of these only 2 offer their courts for hourly rental to the public: The Phoenecian Resort (grass, $35/hr/person) and IronOaks Fitness and Racquet Center (Har-Tru, $10/90min/person). 
	After Roger won his 19th slam at Wimbledon this year (crazy!), I felt like playing on grass as a tribute. Not wanting to drop that much cash, I convinced a friend to help me try the next best thing: Grass-Court Table Tennis. </p>

	<h3>The Court</h3>
	<div class="w3-cell-row">
	<div style="width:5%" class="w3-cell"></div>
	<div style="align:center">
	<p style="text-align:center">I collected grass clippings from my lawn and spread them over the table. There were some leaves mixed in, and the grass sort of clumped together, so it wasn't the most perfect simulation.</p>

	<h3>Findings</h3>
	<div class="w3-cell-row">
	<div style="width:5%" class="w3-cell"></div>
	<div style="align:center">
	<p style="text-align:center">The ball definitely skid and bounced unpredictably and low off the grass. This was expected, but the magnitude in table tennis appears greater than in real tennis. I haven't played on grass, so I can't know, but logically the table tennis ball is very light and perhaps more easily affected by the surface. It sort of just stops when it hits the grass. That could be because of the clumpiness and leaves. To do this right, we'd need <a href="http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/grass_courts.html">100% Perennial Rye cut to exactly 8mm</a>.
	<br><br>Maybe the only interesting finding is that we got used to the physics of the grass after a few minutes of hitting. We were able keep rallies going, in spite of the clumps and leaves. It shows that our reflexes can learn  and adapt quickly to the conditions, no matter how absurd. </p>
